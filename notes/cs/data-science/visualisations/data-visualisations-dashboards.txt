##### Introduction
Dashboards are dense displays of charts. They are used to allow us to represent and understand the key *metrics* of a given issue as quickly and effective as possible.

A good example is the display of server logs, website users, and business data within such dashboards. One definition of a dashboard is as follows,

	*"A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objective; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the ifnromation can be monitored at a glance."*

	Few, Stephen. *Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data.* O'Reilly Media. 2006.

So, dashboards are visual displays of information. They can contain text elements, but are primarily a visual display of data rendered as meaningful information. 

The information needs to be consumed quickly, and there is often simply no available time to read long annotations or repeatedly click controls. The information needs to be visible, and ready to be consumed. Dashboards are normally presented as a complementary environment and option to other tools and analytical/exploratory options. 

One of the design issues presented by dashboards is how to effectively distribute the available space. Compact charts that permit quick data retrieval are normally preferred.

Therefore, dashboards should be designed with a purpose in mind. Generalised information within a dashboard is rarely useful. They should display the most important information that is necessary to achieve their defined purpose. In effect, a dashboard becomes a central view for collated data represented as meaningful, useful information.

##### Good practices
To help promote our information, we need to design the dashboard to exploit all of the available screenn space. We need to use this space to help users absorb as much information as possible. 

Some visual elements are more easily perceived and absored by users than others. Likewise, some naturally convey and communicate information more effectively than others. Such attributes are known as **preattentive attributes of visual perception**. 

For example, 

  * **Colour** - there are many different colour models currently available, but the most useful relevant to dashboard design is the *HSL* model. This model describes colour in terms of three attributes,
    * *hue* - this is what we normally call colour
    * *saturation* - intensity of colour
    * *lightness* (in effect, brightness) - 
Our perception of colour will, more often than not, depend upon its context. For example, a light colour will draw attention if it is surrounded by a dark colour. So, we can use colour within a dashboard design to attract a user's attention to areas of the screen that require attention.
  * **Form** - correct use of length, width, and general size can convey quantitative dimensions, each with varying degrees of precision. We can also use the Laws of Pragnanz to manipulate groups of similar shapes and designs, thereby easily grouping like data and information for the user.
  * **Position** - the relative positioning of elements can help to communicate the information within a dashboard. Again, the laws of pragnanz teach us that position can often infer a perception of relationship and similarity. Higher items are often perceived as being better, and items on the left of the screen will traditionally be seen first by a western user.

Naturally, we can use these design guidelines and suggestions to inform our decisions relative to the layout of a dashboard. To effectively use all of the available screen space, we need to ensure that we select only the information that counts, and design compact charts and general graphics. Such charts and graphics need to be clear, concise, and direct, thereby reducing the need for explicit decoding to a bare minimum. 

Zoning and organisation of information should follow a logical pattern to guide and inform the user. 

##### Building a dashboard
To begin, we need to clearly determine the questions that need to be answered with the information collated and presented within the dashboard. We also need to ensure that any problems can be detected on time, and be certain why we actually need a dashboard for the current dataset.

By determining these questions and problems, we can then begin to collect the requisite data to help us answer such questions. Naturally, the data can be sourced from multiple, disparate datasets.

From the data we derive the information, which then helps us define the groupings and zones within our dashboard. Effectively, we are conveying a story with the information derived from the datasets.

The chosen visualisations help us to tell this story more effectively, and present it in a manner appealing to our users. We need to consider information visualisations that will be familiar to our users, and reduce the potential for cognitive load.

##### Organisation
To present the information on our dashboard in a meaningful manner, we need to organise the data into logical units of information. Each section of the dashboard should be organised to help highlight and detect any underlying or prevailing issues, and then present them to the user.
