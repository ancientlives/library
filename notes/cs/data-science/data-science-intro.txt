##### What is data science?
Data science, as such, is still very much in its infancy as a discipline or 
sub-discipline of computer science. Therefore, many different definitions often
exist. However, one of the most practical definitions is outlined by Mason and
Wiggins in 2010. They define data science according to the following five steps,

  * obtaining data
  * scrubbing data
  * exploring data
  * modeling data
  * interpreting data

Together, these five steps form the **OSEMN** (pronounced as awesome) model.

It's also interesting to note that data science is, more often than not, an 
iterative and non-linear process. For example, after modeling data, you might 
examine the data, and then decide to return to scrubbing the data to adjust the
features of the data set.
