##### Intro
Different graph databases naturally meet certain requirements and fulfill a given scenario. 

##### NetworkX
A Python based graph toolkit, particularly useful for modeling property graphs. However, it 
is also an in-memory graph database. It is, therefore, limited to the amount of working memory 
on the host machine. Work arounds naturally exist, such as constraining the domain to a subset 
of the required data or simply moving to a machine with more memory.

##### Big Graph Databases
With larger datasets it is no longer suitable to restrict ourselves to in-memory graphs. Increasingly, 
Hadoop and NoSQL are filling this gap.

Nascent development of *big graph databases* that leverage NoSQL databases for storage and provide
property graph semantics. For example,

* Titan

Titan claims that is designed to effectively manage the memory hierarchy in order to scale well. 
We can, of course, compare this with a *semantic* web stack, such as RDF schema, OWL, and SPARQL.
