##### Property Graph
A property graph is a data structure that represents entities with *nodes* and
relationships between entities with *edges*. Each vertex has a unique identifier,
a map of properties, which are defined as standard key/value pairs, and a collection of edges.

Edges are also unique in 
* connecting nodes
* can be uniquely identified
* can also contain properties.

A *digraph* is so-called because its edges are directed, which need not be the case unless
the direction of the edge is rooted in meaning for the modeled domain.

eg: X ----------> Y
