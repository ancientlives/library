##### Intro
A mathematical concept with many uses in computer science. Graphs are available in many
different variations, including

* Simple
* Undirected or directed
* Cyclic or acyclic
* Labeled
* Weighted
* Infinite

and so on...

##### General properties
Majority of graphs are a variation of the following,

* Made up of two sets called vertices and edges
* Vertices derive from some underlying type, and may be finite or infinite
* Each part of the *edge* set is a pair, which consists of two elements from the *vertices* set
* Graphs are often depicted visually
  * elements of the *vertices* set (nodes...) are often drawn as squares or circles
  * elements of the *edges* set as lines or arcs between the squares and circles

##### Graph Variations


##### Property Graph
A property graph can be used to model complex networks. It is a versatile data structure that 
represents entities with *nodes* and relationships between entities with *edges*. Each vertex 
has a unique identifier, a map of properties, which are defined as standard key/value pairs, 
and a collection of edges.

Property graphs provide flexibility and versatility in modeling and querying 
complex data.

Edges are also unique in 
* connecting nodes
* can be uniquely identified
* can also contain properties.

A *digraph* is so-called because its edges are directed, which need not be the case unless
the direction of the edge is rooted in meaning for the modeled domain.

eg: X ----------> Y
