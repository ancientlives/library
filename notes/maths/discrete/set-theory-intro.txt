#### Set theory, intuition, and countable infinity

* set theory in general mathematics provides the foundation for many mathematical principles
* George Cantor is generally credited with formalising the mathematics behind set theory
  * “On a Characteristic Property of All Real Algebraic Numbers” (1874)
  * formalised this theory as part of his ongoing work on answering questions about infinity
    * eg: is the set of positive integers larger in cardinality than the set of both positive and negative integers?
    * Cantor proved that they were both the same. ie: they could both be clearly enumerated but there was no ending point...both sets are said to be countably infinite
      * ie: there is a definite pattern which can be followed deterministically to infinity if there was infinite time (pun intended...)
