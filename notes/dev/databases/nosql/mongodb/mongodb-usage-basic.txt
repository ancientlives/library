### MongoDB - Usage Basic

Brief notes on getting started with using MongoDB.

#### Contents
* Getting started
* First database
* Inserting documents

##### Getting started
To start MongDB, issue the following command

* OS X = `mongod`
* Linux = `sudo service mongod start`

To stop a running session, issue the following command,

* OS X = `ctrl+c`
* Linux = `sudo service mongod stop`
          `sudo service mongod restart`

On OS X, we can then test MongoDb by issuing the following command,

* `mongo`

This uses the current instance of mongod to allow us to connect to `test`. This allows us to test databases etc.

##### First database
To specify our new database, we can issue the following command

`use playground`

This will also switch mongo to the specified database.

##### Inserting documents
We can now add a document to a new collection, *users*, using the following command

`db.users.insert({name:'ancientlives', email:'test@test.com', roles: ['admin', 'operations']})`

followed by `return`.

Mongo will now write this document to the new collection.

##### Querying documents
To query our database for a document, or part, we can use `find` command. This will accept

* an object ID defined by MongoDB
* one of the sub-records of the document, eg: in our new document we can search by
  *  name
  * email
  * roles (and either role as well)

A successful query will return the complet document in JSON.
