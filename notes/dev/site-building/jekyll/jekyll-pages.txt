### Jekyll - Pages

A brief overview of creating and using *pages* in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

#### Contents
* Home page
* Additional pages

##### Home page
As with most servers, Jekyll will look for `index.html` as the home page of the website. This page accepts site wide layouts, liquid 
templating, and other standard features of a Jekyll site.

##### Additional pages
There are two primary options for storing HTML files for pages, which are currently as follows,

* HTML files for each page can be stored in the site's root directory
* create a directory for each page, and add an index.html file

Each of the above methods is fine, although the resultant URL will be different. A file in the root directory will output the same file relative
to the site's root URL. A directory will output the root URL plus the directory for the page. For example, 

`http://www.yourdomain.com/about/`

The file rendered will be `index.html` relative to the parent directory.

Another option includes the use of Markdown files in the root directory. For example, a `contact.md` file will be built with the following URL

`http://www.yourdomain.com/contact/`

This page will, therefore, be served as `index.html` relative to the parent directory.
