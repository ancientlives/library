##### Introduction
Jekyll, as with most web design, allows us to create our own site theming. We can incorporate existing JS libraries, icon 
sets, CSS stylesheets, and much more.

##### Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is a 'popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first
projects on the web'.

To use Bootstrap within our theme, we can download the default [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download)
version, and add to our Jekyll site's root directory. 

##### Layout
To create our initial layout we save a `default.html` file to the `_layouts` folder. This becomes the default layout for our 
site, and is used to style all of our posts and pages. It becomes the default template for site rendering.

We design this template in the same manner as a standard HTML site page, but we use [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki)
template engine to insert custom data. For example, a site title, include files for a header and footer, and much more.

##### Include

In a similar fashion to PHP's `include` statement, we can abstract aspects of a template, such as the header and footer markup,
which allows us to use the same design across our whole site. These files are stored in the `_includes` directory in the root directory 
of a Jekyll build.

We can create, for example, an include for our header, footer, and sidebar. We can also include any other site wide material, including Bootstrap 
specific requirements.

##### Scripts
CSS and Javascript files can be stored in a specific directory, for example `assets`, which is then referenced in standard HTML fashion from within
our template.
