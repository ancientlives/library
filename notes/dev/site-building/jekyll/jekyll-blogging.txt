##### Introduction
Blogging with Jekyll is similar to Wordpress, for example, in the general concepts required to build a blog. For example, Jekyll posts use a 
similar *looping* concept. 

A *post loop* is simply a way of ensuring that a blogging platform returns a certain list of posts. This will often be as simple as requesting 
posts one to ten, and then an overflow onto the second page, and so on. This example request uses an iterator to output the same HTML content for
each block of ten posts. Therefore, the same code to output as many posts as needed, each in blocks of ten.

##### Saving
Jekyll supports posts written in Markdown and Textile.

Each blog post is an individual file, which is saved in the `_posts` folder. These posts must be saved, however, using the following naming format

`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

Obviously, the file extension needs to match the markup employed for each file. Also, each word in a title needs to be separated with a dash. An 
example post file might be saved as follows,

`2014-06-21-first-day-of-summer.md`

##### Post slug

The above type of URL is often referred to as a *post slug*, which is URL friendly format for a post's name. A few conventions apply,

* no spaces, unusual characters, or anything not normally permitted in a URL
* standard convention suggests lower case letters, and dashes instead of spaces
* keep the slug relatively short

##### Formats
All post files must begin with `YAML Front Matter`.
