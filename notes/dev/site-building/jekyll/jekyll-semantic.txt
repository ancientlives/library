##### Introduction
Jekyll offers a few basic options for creating a site's categories, and adding a folksonomy through tagging. Related information, such as posts,
can also be determined from this categorisation.

##### Tagging
In the YAML front matter, we can add custom defined tags for a page, post etc. These can be called for the page itself when it is loaded. For
example,

```
tags:
- index
- semantics
- folksonomy
```

and so on. We can then output these tags as follows,

`{{ page.tags }}`

We can also list all posts for a given tag. For example,

`site.tags.tag`

##### Categorisation
Defining categories for a page, post etc follows the same pattern as tagging.
