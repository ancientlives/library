A basic guide to configuring Jekyll websites, and some of the more interesting options as well.

#### Contents
* Config

##### Config
Configuration for Jekyll is completed using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org). The configurations are
generally kept in a file called `_config.yml`.

This config file allows us to specify settings, including

* name
* description
* url (eg: a custom domain name)
* paginate
* flavour of markdown
* type of permalink
* pygments (boolean value)

*NB:* Pygments provides support for syntax highlighting in over 100 languages. This requires Python installed on your 
system.
