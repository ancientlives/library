### Jekyll - Basic Guide

A basic guide to configuring Jekyll websites, and some of the more interesting options as well.

#### Contents
* Config
* Boilerplate
* Basic site

##### Config
Configuration for Jekyll is completed using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org). The configurations are
generally kept in a file called `_config.yml`.

This config file allows us to specify settings, including

* name
* description
* url (eg: a custom domain name)
* paginate
* flavour of markdown
* type of permalink
* highlighter (eg: pygments)

*NB:* Pygments provides support for syntax highlighting in over 100 languages. This requires Python installed on your 
system.

##### Boilerplate
For a very quick boilerplate site use the following commands,

* `gem install jekyll`
* `jekyll new mywebsite`
* `cd mywebsite`
* `jekyll server`

This provisions a basic site template, which can be viewed at

* http://localhost:4000

##### Basic site
A few initial steps to follow to create a starter site for Jekyll.

* create `_config.yml`
  * save to root of site directory
  * add name, description, url, markdown processor (if custom), permalink, pygments...
* create `_includes` directory
  * allows developers/theme designers to organise common files together, eg: site-wide header, footer...
* create `_layout` directory
  * stores textual/page layout files. This allows custom layouts for different files etc...
* create `_posts` directory
  * this will contain the Markdown or HTML/Textile files for blog posts
  * NB: if you do not need a blog, this directory is not necessary

We can now build the site to test Jekyll,

`jekyll build`
