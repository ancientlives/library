##### Introduction
Jekyll uses the *Liquid* temple engine to process templates. Liquid's standard tags and filters are supports, and there are a few useful filters
and tags added by Jekyll itself. These are primarily for common tasks.

##### Filters
Template filters include date manipulation and formatting, array usage and manipulation, string manipulation and formatting, url formatting, and
basic JSON usage. A full list is available at [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/). 

##### Tags - Includes
This allows a developer to ember small code fragments in a file. It works in a similar fashion to PHP's `include`. For example,

`{% include footer.html %}

All include files need to be stored in the `_includes` directory in Jekyll.

Jekyll includes can also include parameters, 

`{% include footer.html param="copyright_year" %}`

which are then accessible via Liquid

` {{ include.param }}`

We can also use `include_relative` to store an include file relative to the current file's path. However, this include will then only be available
from that local directory. For example, if a file stored at `_posts/2014-12-31-file.md` uses the `include_relative` tag, the include file must be 
in the same directory of a sub-directory.

##### Tags - Code highlighting
Jekyll supports syntax highlighting using *Pygments*, which supports over 100 languages. You can also use *Rouge*, if preferred. We can also force
the highlighter to include line numbers for the highlighted code block.

##### Tags - Post URL
It is possible to included a link to a post on your site, which includes the correct permalink URL for the post. This `post_url` tag can also be
used to create a link to a site post in Markdown.

##### Tags - Gist
We can also embed GitHub Gists on a Jekyll site using the `gist` tag.
