##### Introduction
Jekyll accespts custom data, which is accessed via the *Liquid* template engine. It supports loading data from *YAML*, *JSON*, and *CSV* files,
which are stored in `_data` directory. 

*NB:* *CSV* files must contain a header row.

##### Data folder
In Jekyll, the `_data` folder is used to store additional data for processing during the site build. These data files must be *YAML* compliant, 
and a `.yml, .yaml, .json or csv` file extension is supported. These data files are also accessible via `site.data`.

##### Example usage
A data file might be used to store repetitive data, such as a group or member list, to avoid tedious duplication throughout a site. For example,
a list can be stored in `_data/members.yml`, and then accessed via `site.data.members`. The filename determines the variable name.

We could then access this data as follows,

	{% for member in site.data.members %}
	{{ member.name }}
	{% endfor %}

Data files can also be stored in sub-folders of the `_data` folder. Each hierarchical level is then added to the variable's namespace.
