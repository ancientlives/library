A brief overview of setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub pages. Further details can be found on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

##### Intro
GitHub pages currently supports hosting sites using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) generated static sites. It also supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), 
which allows text to HTML conversion. It also supports standard HTML sites, although this requires opting out of the default Jekyll option.

##### Initial setup - Jekyll sites
Sites hosted on GitHub pages, excluding opt-out HTML sites, are processed through Jekyll each time content is pushed to your GitHub Pages' repository. For user pages, and not
project pages, content should be pushed to the `master` branch. Project pages should be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch of the project's repository.

##### Jekyll installation
There is now a GitHub Pages specific install for Jekyll, which allows local testing before pushing content to your remote repository. Essentially, this eases potential issues 
by replicating locally the GitHub Pages build environment.

Assuming you have Ruby and Gems installed and configured correctly, we also need to install the following,

* Bundler - `gem install bundler`

* Jekyll
  * create a `Gemfile` in your site's root directory and add the following to this file.

	`source 'https://rubygems.org'`
	`gem 'github-pages'`	

  * run the command `bundle install`

If you encounter any install issues with Jekyll simply follow the messages on the Terminal. For example, on Mac OS X you'll need the XCode terminal tools installed before running 
the above command. To install these terminal tools run the following command,

* `xcode-select --install`

##### Running Jekyll
With this installation, we can now run Jekyll locally to match GitHub Pages' build server. To enable this option, we run Jekyll with Bundler using the following command

* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

This will then serve your site locally at `http://localhost:4000`. 

##### Updating Jekyll
To ensure parity with the latest build server for GitHub Pages, we need to check for applicable updates. To update this install, we can run the following command

* `bundle update`

##### Configure Jekyll
As with a standard Jekyll site, we can configure most site setting using a `_config.yml` file. This should be saved to the root directory of your site.

Frontmatter is also required, again as with a standard Jekyll site.

##### Disable Jekyll
We can also choose to disable Jekyll for GitHub Pages by creating a file called `.nojekyll`, which is saved to the root directory of your site.

However, as Jekyll happily processes vanilla HTML files it is normally only necessary to invoke this option for directories starting with an underscore.
