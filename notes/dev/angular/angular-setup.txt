##### Introduction
*angular-seed* provides a bare-bones framework for developing web apps in angular.js. The following is a set of install 
and setup notes for 8angular-seed* on Ubuntu 14.04.

##### Requirements
To install and use *angular-seed* you will also need to install *git*, *node*, *npm*, and *bower*.

##### Clone the source
Clone the latest version of *angular-seed* as follows,

`git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git`

and then cd to your *angular-seed* directory.

##### Install dependencies
There are two types of dependencies required for the *angular-seed* app, which are as follows,

* tools for *angular-seed* from *npm*
* angular code from *bower*

To install these dependencies, we simply run the following command

`npm install`

##### npm issues
If we encounter any issues with *npm* we can try the following,

* `npm test`
* `npm update`
* `bower update`

##### Running the app
To run the *angular-seed* app we can use the following command

`npm start`

This will start the *http-server* and by default serves the app at the following URL,

* http://localhost:8000/app/index.html

##### Custom domain and port
We can modify the domain and port in the *package.json* file. Our new app URL will be as follows,

* http://yourdomain.com:8080/app/index.html

If using *ufw* we'll also need to set the correct rules for our custom port. 

##### Testing - Unit testing
Unit tests are pre-configured for the *angular-seed* app. To run unit tests issue the followin command,

`npm test`

This will call *Karma*, which will execute the unit tests. It will also monitor changes in the source and test files.
If you run unit tests each time a file is saved, *karma* will also run unit tests at the same time.

To perform a single test, use the following command.

`npm run test-single-run`

##### Updating angular
To update the tool dependencies run the following command,

`npm update`

To update the Angular dependencies run the following command,

`bower update`
