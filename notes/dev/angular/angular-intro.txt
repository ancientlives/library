##### What is angular.js?
Angular.js is a powerful framework for building and deploying browser based web applications. 
These applications characteristically are highly interactive, and angular.js comes with many 
existing components for building useful applications. It is also highly modular in structure,
and supports extensive testing.

Angular.js has some interesting features including,

* Ajax helpers
* Animations
* Dependency injection
* DOM manipulation
* Testing helpers and utilites
* Two-way data binding
* ...

##### Angular vs JQuery
Put simply, JQuery is imperative and Angular is declarative. This means that in JQuery a developer 
manipulates the DOM, whereas in Angular you are able to declare the DOM structure beforehand.

A good way to think of this is as follows,

* JQuery manipulates an existing HTML page
* Angular helps to build the page from the start

For example, with JQuery you would need to know the structure, class etc of an <li> element to be able 
to modify, add, delete etc. You would also need to keep track of this element to be able to modify.
Angular allows a developer to use *directives*, which are special, custom HTML attributes that 
Angular understands will change the HTML for the user etc.

Example directives might include `ng-repeat` or `ng-click`.

In effect, Angular.js splits the logic from the presentation. In JQuery, the need for DOM selectors ensures 
that they are tied together.

Angular.js code also tends to be more concise.
