### Markdown - Basics

An overview of the basic syntax for Markdown. Markdown was created to be easy to read, write, and publish.
Markdown is simply a text-to-HTML conversion tool for online, web writers. It allows writers to format their 
plain text documents with a simple syntax, and then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML4 if required).

##### Introduction
Markdown was created to be easy to read, write, and publish.

Markdown is simply a text-to-HTML conversion tool for online, web writers. It allows writers to format their
plain text documents with a simple syntax, and then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML4 if required).

#### <a name="toc-bw"></a>Basic-Writing

##### Paragraphs
No specific syntax in Markdown for paragraphs. They are simply one or more lines of consecutive text, which 
is followed by one or more blank lines.

#### <a name="toc-headings"></a>Headings
Following the example of HTML syntax, Markdown permits headings equivalent to h1 through h6.
A simple hash character `#` is used to indicate the heading number, incrementing from one to six.
This is equivalent to h1 through h6 in HTML.

##### Blockquotes
Markdown indicates blockquotes with a greater than sign `>`

##### Styling Text
Text can be marked as bold or italic. A single asterisk or underscore marks italic markup, and 
a set of double asterisks or underscores marks bold markup.

#### <a name="toc-lists"></a>Lists

##### Unordered lists
Unordered lists can be written using either a single asterisk or dash preceding the list item.

##### Ordered lists
Simply precede list items with the required, ordered number.

##### Nested lists
List items can be nested by indenting each list item by two spaces.

#### <a name="toc-cf"></a>Code Formatting

##### Inline formats
Markdown syntax allows code etc to be marked without processing. To mark any special text, simply
use a single backtick (`) to wrap the special text.

##### Multiple lines
You can also format multiple lines as a distinct block of text by wrapping in
triple backticks (```).

#### <a name="toc-links"></a>Links
Links in Markdown are created as a pair indicating link title and link reference.
The link title is wrapped in brackets `[]`, and the link reference is in parenthesis `()`.
