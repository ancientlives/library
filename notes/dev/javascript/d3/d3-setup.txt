##### Introduction
D3 is s custom javascript library designed for the manipulation of data centric
documents. D3 uses a custom library with HTML, CSS, and SVG to create graphically
rich, informative documents for the presentation of data. Essentially, it uses a
data-driven approach to manipulate the document object model (DOM).

##### Basic Setup
Setup and configuration of D3 is pretty straightforward. The most involved aspect
is the configuration of a web server, assuming you do not have an existing setup 
in place.

D3.js works with standard HTML files and, therefore, requires a web server simply
capable of parsing and rendering HTML and associated files. For example, we could
this code on a full LAMP stack on a remote server, or simply use XAMPP etc. We can
also invoke Python's built-in *SimpleHTTPServer* as follows,

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &
```

for Python 2.x, and *http.server* for Python 3.x,

```
python -m http.server 8888 &
```

This runs a local web server, which is available at the following URL,

```
http://localhost:8888/
```

On Mac OS X, this defaults to the route directory of the current logged in user.

After configuring a web server to test and run D3 projects, simply download the 
latest version from D3's [GitHub](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) page.

Latest release notes is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/releases/).

##### Configuration
Create a new directory for testing D3 projects on your preferred web server.

To make it easier to reference site assets, create a new directory in the root
of your test site called *assets*. This will store CSS, Javascript, and other
site assets including site logo etc.

Create a standard *index.html* file in your project's root directory.

An initial example directory structure is as follows,

. 
|- index.html
|- assets
   |- scripts
      |- d3
         |- d3.js
   |- styles
      |- style.css

One of the requirements for parsing D3 within our HTML is a UTF-8 encoding reference
within a *meta* element in the *head* section of our file.

As with other Javascript libraries, such as JQuery, we simply reference the D3
library with a standard script element in the *head* section of our HTML file.

We also need a script element in the body of our HTML document, which is used for the
D3 code itself.
