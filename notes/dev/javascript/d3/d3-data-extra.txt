A brief overview of extra options available whilst using the [D3](http://d3js.org) Javascript library.

##### Data joins with keys
A data join happens each time we bind data to elements in the DOM. Effectively, each time
we call `data()`.

Default join is by *index order*, which effectively gives us a logical, indexed order
to DOM selection and assignment. 

eg: the first data value is bound to the first DOM element selected, and the second data
to the second DOM element...

If data values and DOM elements are not in the same order, we can specify a key for ordering
either. This effectively tells D3 how to join or pair values and elements. This is specified
using a *key function*.

We can use a *key funtion* to control the data join with greater specificity, thereby ensuring
that the correct datum is bound to the correct *rect* element.
