### React - Fundamentals - Forms

A quick introduction to using forms in the React JavaScript library. Further details are available at the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) website.

##### Intro
As with other aspects of one-page applications, React helps to manage `state` for forms. There are two types of form components in React, which include *controlled* and *uncontrolled*.

##### Uncontrolled components
In a strange way, *uncontrolled* can be considered a type of anti-pattern for how many other components are constructed in React.

So, if we consider a HTML form we can certainly see that it works differently to React components. For example, HTML `input` may be given a value, which can then be mutated by the `input`. This is where the name originates, effectively because the form component's value is *Uncontrolled* by a React component.

An *Uncontrolled* component is also of little use unless we can access the value. However, in order to access this value we need to add a `ref` to the `input`, and then access the `DOMNode` value.

A `ref` is a special *non-DOM* attribute, which we can use to identify a component within its local context `this`. Also, all `refs` are added to `this.refs` for easier access.

For example,

```
//basic input and output to alert...
  var BasicForm = React.createClass({
    formSubmit: function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      var basicText = React.findDOMNode(this.refs.basicInput).value;
      alert(basicText);
    },
    render: function() {
      return (
        <form onSubmit={this.formSubmit}>
          <input
          ref="basicInput"
          type="text"
          defaultValue="basic input..." />
          <br />
          <button
            type="submit">
            Submit
          </button>
        </form>
      );
    }
  });

  React.render(<BasicForm />, document.getElementById('example'));
```

Uncontrolled components are particularly useful for basic forms. In particular, those forms that do not require special validation or input controls.
