##### Introduction
When designing React apps, we often think about stateless children and a stateful parent. As noted in the React documentation,

> A common pattern is to create several stateless components that just render data,
> and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to
> its children via props.

So, we need to carefully consider how to identify and implement this type of component hierarchy.
