##### Introduction
This note focuses on how to build a basic sample application with the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) JavaScript library.

It follows the example *comments* application available in the React [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

This app includes the following basic features,

* rendered output view of all of the comments
* a simple form to submit new comments
* hooks, where applicable, to provide a custom backend for the application

It will also include some quirky test features,

* optimistic commenting - comments will appear in the rendered output view before they're saved to the server
* live updates - comments created by other users will be added to the rendered output view in real time
* Markdown formatting - comment creation will support Markdown formatting

##### Setup
A few quick requirements to setup our basic application.

###### Server
To run and test this application, in particular the `POST` requirements, we need to setup and use a server. React provides a number of simple example servers, which can be downloaded from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial/). These simple servers are currently available in Node, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Go.
