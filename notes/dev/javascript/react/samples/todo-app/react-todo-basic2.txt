### React - Samples - ToDo App - Basic2

Development notes, part 2, for building a very basic To-Do app using the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) JavaScript library.

##### Introduction
This is the second sample code for the To-Do app built using React. This update includes a basic table filter

##### Components
In addition to the basic components of version 1, we can add the following

* FilterOption

This allows a user to select whether they want to see all of the to-do list items or just those marked *high priority*.

Within our overall component hierarchy, it fits as follows

*  FullTodoTable
	* FilterOption
	* TodoTable
		* TodoRow

##### FilterOption
We can add a simple filter option using a form with a checkbox to allow a user to only show high priority to-do items.

```
//filter option
var FilterOption = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <form>
        <input type="checkbox" />
        {' '}
        Show High-Priority Items
      </form>
    );
  }
});
```

This will show the checkbox and accompanying text, but it won't actually filter the table. We need to handle user input for the selection of the checkbox, and then update the table.
