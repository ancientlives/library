##### Introduction
This is the first sample code for the To-Do app built using React.

##### Components
For React applications, we need to clearly identify components and sub-components of the UI for easier development. We will also be using a bottom-up development pattern for these components, which tends to make component testing easier as we scale our applications.

###### Outline
Our basic to-do list app includes the following defined initial components,

*  FullTodoTable
	* TodoTable
		* TodoCategoryRow
		* TodoRow

Working bottom-up for the development of these components, we can start with the `todorow` component.
