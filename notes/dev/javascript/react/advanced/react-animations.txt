##### Intro
React has a *Transition Groups* addon, which works with CSS3 to help incorporate animated transitions in React based apps.

Unlike most animation libraries or plugins, which traditionally use an imperative approach, such as selecting an element and then moving it around or modifying its style to create animation, React employs a more declarative approach. This is due to the core nature of React, which employs the render and re-render approach.

CSS *transition groups* enable css animations for transitions, effectively modifying classes during appropriate timed renders and re-renders.

##### Animation options
So, what can we actually do with animations in React? For example, we can now

* animate transitions between states using CSS3 and Transition Groups
* animate outside CSS, such as scroll position and Canvas drawing by using `requestAnimationFrame`
* fall back to `setTimeout` when `requestAnimationFrame` is not a viable option
