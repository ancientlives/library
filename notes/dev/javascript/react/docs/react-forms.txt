### React - Forms

A quick introduction to working with forms in the React JavaScript library. Further details are available at the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) website. These notes are based in part on the online [docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).

##### Intro
Aspects of form design and usage necessitate user interaction, which often leads to change and updates for the app itself. In React, form components such as `input`, `textarea`, and `option` provide interfaces to help us manage forms in response to these updates and interactions.

##### Interactive props
There are a few `props` affected by user interactions,

For `input`,

* `checked` and `value`

For `option`,

* `selected`

For `textarea`,

* `value`

**NB:** in standard HTML the value of a `textarea` is set via children. However, in React we should use the `value` prop instead.

###### Callbacks
We can listen for changes in form components by setting a *callback* to the `onChange` prop. This prop fires in response to user interactions as follows,

* `value` of `input` or `textarea` changes
* `checked` state of `input` changes
* `selected` state of `option` changes
