### React - Tooling - Basic

A quick introduction to basic tooling with the *browser* in the React JavaScript library. Further details are available at the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) website. These notes are based in part on the online [docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).

##### Intro
React has been designed to be as environment-agnostic as possible to allow developers to use their preferred JavaScript toolchain where possible.

However, there are some basic tools that make working with React a little bit easier.

##### React files
There are two primary sources for the latest React JavaScript and tools.

* CDN hosting
	CDN hosted versions are available on the React [download](https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html) page. These downloads include various versions, and options for both development and production usage.
* Master
	Build from *master* using the instructions included in React's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/react).

##### JSX
JSX can be used either with in-browser transformation or using a production alternative pre-compiled form.

The in-browser option simply requires a `script` tag and link to the jsx file. For example,

```
<script src="build/JSXTransformer.js"></script>
```

However, for production ready apps and projects its better to use the `react-tools` to translate JSX syntax compatible files to plain JavaScript. These will then run natively in the browser without the need for the above JSX transformer.

The other benefit is that the tools will also watch directories in the project, and automatically transform any changed files.
