##### intro
**npm** is a package manager for the node.js JavaScript library. Developers can easily use **npm** to share and reuse modules in node.js applications. **npm** can also be used to share complete node.js applications. Example modules might include,

* Markup, YAML etc parsers
* database connectors

and many more.

##### installing - basic
`npm` is included with the default installers available at the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) website. For further information, and other install options, please consult the [npmjs](http://npmjs.org) website.

To test whether **npm** is installed, simply issue the following command 

`npm`

This should output some helpfuk information if **npm** is currently installed.

**NB:** on a Unix system, such as OS X or Linux, it is best to avoid installing **npm** with `sudo` privileges.

##### installing - modules
To install existing **npm** modules, use the following type of command

`npm install express`

This will install the module named `express` in the current directory.

##### importing modules
To import modules in our node.js code we can use the following,

```
var module = require('express');
```

When we run this application, it will look for the required module library and its source code.
