### Node - Basics

Introductory notes on the basics of using and running node.js server and apps. These notes assume you have node.js, npm
etc already installed and working globally.

* Create a basic server

##### Create a basic server
Create a new directory for your node project, and then create a new file called `app.js`.

Add the following to your `app.js` file,

var http = require("http");
http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}).listen(3000);

The write output and port number for the server can obviously be changed as required.

To run this app, simply issue the following command,

`node app.js`

and then view the output in your browser at the following url,

`http://localhost:3000`

*NB:* the `createServer` function is being called against the *HTTP* module, and is then being passed a new, anonymous
function. This new function is not executed immediately, but will wait until the web server receives a new request. This is an example of *callback*. Node simply stores the function until it is needed upon receipt of a request.

To end the server, simply press `Ctrl+c`.
