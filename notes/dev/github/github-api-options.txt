##### Intro
Base fundamental primitives for GitHub are its *users* and *projects*. 
Each user has their own public profile, which normally includes some repositories. These may have been created by the given user or forked from another
user. 

One of the strengths, and indeed powers, of GitHub is a user's ability to fork such repositories 
and, effectively, modify this code and work in any fashion they see fit. This is, naturally, subject to license provisions and restrictions.

A user can also bookmark or *star* a project to become what is known as a *stargazer* of a project.
Each bookmark is saved and shown in a user's list of GitHub bookmarks, naturally for quick reference.

##### API Connection
As with many other APIs, GitHub similarly implements OAuth for its authentication.

Many different languages currently support OAuth, and this includes various libraries.

* PHP can use OAuth from Zend etc
* Python can use the PyGithub library 

and so on...
