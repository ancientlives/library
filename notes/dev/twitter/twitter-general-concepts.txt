##### <a name="toc-ot"></a>Overview of Tweets

* 140 characters in length
* A Twitter platform object
* Each tweet includes additional metadata, in particular
  * Entities
    * User mentions, hashtags, URLs, and media that may be associated with a tweet
  * Places
    * Locations in the real world that may be attached to a tweet
    * May include location from where a tweet was sent or a referenced place in a tweet

##### <a name="toc-time"></a>Timelines

* Chronologically sorted collections of tweets
* A timeline could be any collection of tweets displayed in chronological order
* Two prevalent types
  * Home timeline is all tweets from users that you are following, normally shown
when you login to your account
  * User timeline is a collection of tweets for a given user
* Often perceived as streams of tweets with relatively low velocity
  * Public firehose of all tweets is a different matter entirely...

##### <a name="toc-ig"></a>Interest Graph

* We may consider as a way of modelling connections between people and their
arbitrary interests...
* Provide many options in data science that primarily involve 
  * measuring correlations
  * making intelligent recommendations
  * other applications in machine learning
* Relative to an interest graph, a Twitter user need not necessarily be a real person
* Twitter enables you to create, connect, and explore a community of interest for 
an arbitrary topic of interest
  * important distinction from some social websites, which require accounts to 
correspond to real persons, living people, businesses, or entities of a similar 
nature that fits into a particular, given taxonomy

##### <a name="toc-org"></a>Organisation

* Relies on self-organising behavious such as following relationships and 
folksonomies that emerge from the use of hashtags to create a certain kind of
order within the system
